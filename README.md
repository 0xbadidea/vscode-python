# Setting Python Development Environment with VScode and Docker

WIP üöß üèó pre spellcheck

This repo provides a step-by-step guide and a template for setting up a Python üêç development environment with VScode and Docker üê≥. Docker is an amazing tool, but it has some learning curve. This tutorial aims to reduce the entry barrier for learning tools such as Docker.

## Motivation

If you have never used Docker or VScode, this section explains the advantages of each tool and why they work so well together.

### Why develop with Docker üê≥?

Docker is a CI/CD tool that enables seamless code deployment from development to production environments. By creating OS-level virtualization, it can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container. The main advantages of using Docker within your development environment are:
- **Reproducibility** - Docker enables you to seamlessly package your code and its dependencies into a single container and execute, test, share, and deploy it with a high level of consistency
- **Collaboration** - Docker solves the dependencies madness when a team of developers works together on a specific project. Having a unified environment saves a ton of time during the development step. For example, if one developer gets some error, it is easy for other developers to reproduce the error and help debug it
- **Deployment** - Docker simplify the code shipment from the development environment to the production


### Why VScode üíª?

VScode (aka Visual Studio Code) is a general-purpose free code editor developed by Microsoft. It can be run locally on Windows, macOS, and Linux OSs or on a cloud environment. The main advantages of using VScode as your IDE are:
- **Multi-languages** - VScode supports out-of-the-box JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, and has a variety of extensions that enable running other programming languages such as Python, C++, C#, Go, etc.
- **Extensions** - VScode has a large community support that builds and maintains a variety of extensions that extend the editor's capabilities and functionality. That includes extensions that support programming languages (such as Python, R, and Julia), plugs-in that enables connection with external applications (Docker, Postgres, etc.), and other applications
- **Git integration** - VScode has built-in integration with Git
- **Docker integration** - VScode supports natively Docker integration, which we will dive deep into in the coming sections

In addition, VScode is free and open source üåà.

### VScode + Docker + Python=  ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è

Docker's high reproducibility, coupled with the seamless integration of Visual Studio Code with Docker, makes it a great development tool, particularly for Python developers. This integration enables developers to easily create, test, and deploy their Python applications in a consistent and reproducible environment, ensuring that their code runs as expected. 


## Scope

## Prerequisites 

Generally, this tutorial does not require a previous experience with Docker and VScode. In line with the tutorial scope above, the goal is to teach you how to set up a Python development environment using Docker and VScode. However, if you are new to Docker, I highly recommend taking one of the Docker crash courses prior to starting with this tutorial.

The main requirements for this tutorial are setting VScode and Docker Desktop. In addition, you will need to set up an account to Docker Hub.

### Installing VScode

Installing VScode is straightforward - go to the VScode website https://code.visualstudio.com/ and click on the Download button (purple rectangle on the screenshot):

Download the installation file and follow the instructions. 

To set the Python environment with Docker in VScode we will need the following extensions:

- **Dev Containers** - this extension enables to open a folder and execute a code inside a Docker container (more info available [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers))
- **Python** - the main Python plug-in for VScode, enables to execute, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, etc. (more info available [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python))

Here is how to install an extension on VScode: 
- Click the Extensions button on the left menu (mark with a purple arrow on the screenshot below) 
- Type the extension name on the search menu (see the yellow rectangular). You can see the search results below, and clicking on each extension will open a window with the extension details. 
- Last but not least, Click the install button (see the green rectangular) to install the extension

### Setting Docker
Various ways exist to build and run Docker images on different operations systems. For the purpose of this guide, we will be utilizing Docker Desktop. It is a user-friendly container management interface that is compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems.

Note: Docker Desktop is free for personal use but requires a license for commercial use. For further information, please refer to https://www.docker.com/pricing/.

To install Docker Desktop, go to Docker website and follow the installation instructions according to your OS:

### Docker Hub

Container Registry has a similar functionality as Github for code, and it uses to store and share images. There are many container registries, and the most common is  Docker Hub. We will use throughout the tutorial Docker Hub to pull different images, such as Python built-in images. To register and create an account go to https://hub.docker.com and follow the registration instructions.

After installing Docker Desktop and setting account on Docker Hub, open Docker Desktop, and from the command line, login to Docker Hub:

``` shell
 docker login
```

For the login, you will have to enter your username and password, and you should expect the following output if the login is successful:

``` shell
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: rkrispin
Password:
Login Succeeded

Logging in with your password grants your terminal complete access to your account.
For better security, log in with a limited-privilege personal access token. Learn more at https://docs.docker.com/go/access-tokens/
```
**Note:**  Docker Hub is completely public (at the free tier). Any image you push and store there will be available for all other users. **NEVER** store credentials, passwords, or any other sensitive information on your Docker images.


### Hello World!

There is no better way to test if Docker was installed properly than by running whalesay (or üê≥  say) Docker's most `Hello World!` common example. The whalesay is an adaption of the Linux cowsay (üêÆ say) game using a whale instead of a cow to print some text. Let's run the below code from the terminal to print `Hello Python Users! üëã üêç`:

``` shell
docker run docker/whalesay cowsay Hello Python Users! üëã üêç
```
If this is the first time you are using Docker or your first time using the `whalesay` image you should expect the following message:

``` shell
Unable to find image 'docker/whalesay:latest' locally
```

That is a generic message that notifies that the requested image cannot be found locally, and Docker will try to pull the image from the hub (if specified) and follow by downloading the image:


``` shell
latest: Pulling from docker/whalesay
Image docker.io/docker/whalesay:latest uses outdated schema1 manifest format. Please upgrade to a schema2 image for better future compatibility. More information at https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/deprecated-schema-v1/

Status: Downloaded newer image for docker/whalesay:latest
```

And this is the expected output:

```

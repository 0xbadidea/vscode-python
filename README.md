# Setting Python Development Environment with VScode and Docker

This repo provides a step-by-step guide and a template for setting up a Python üêç development environment with VScode and Docker üê≥. Docker is an amazing tool, but it has some learning curve. This tutorial aims to reduce the entry barrier for learning tools such as Docker.


## Motivation

If you have never used Docker or VScode, this section explains the advantages of each tool and why they work so well together.

### Why develop with Docker üê≥?

Docker is a CI/CD tool that enables seamless code deployment from development to production environments. By creating OS-level virtualization, it can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container. The main advantages of using Docker within your development environment are:
- **Reproducibility** - Docker enables you to seamlessly package your code and its dependencies into a single container and execute, test, share, and deploy it with a high level of consistency
- **Collaboration** - Docker solves the dependencies madness when a team of developers works together on a specific project. Having a unified environment saves a ton of time during the development step. For example, if one developer gets some error, it is easy for other developers to reproduce the error and help debug it
- **Deployment** - Docker simplify the code shipment from the development environment to the production


### Why VScode üíª?

VScode (aka Visual Studio Code) is a general-purpose free code editor developed by Microsoft. It can be run locally on Windows, macOS, and Linux OSs or on a cloud environment. The main advantages of using VScode as your IDE are:
- **Multi-languages** - VScode supports out-of-the-box JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, and has a variety of extensions that enable running other programming languages such as Python, C++, C#, Go, etc.
- **Extensions** - VScode has a large community support that builds and maintains a variety of extensions that extend the editor's capabilities and functionality. That includes extensions that support programming languages (such as Python, R, and Julia), plugs-in that enables connection with external applications (Docker, Postgres, etc.), and other applications
- **Git integration** - VScode has built-in integration with Git

In addition, VScode is free and open source üåà.
